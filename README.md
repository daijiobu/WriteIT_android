# WriteIT_android

WriteIT is an android app which aims to allow users to create their own "QR codes". Users would scan a handwritten word/picture (which is a "QR code" since handwriting is 99% differentiable), and attach a link to this. Other users can then scan the handwritten word and get the link attached to it.
